# I am applying as Android developer, using Kotlin language

Hello, my name is Jes√∫s Medina.

First of all, thanks for taking the time to view my app and read the README to learn more about the app.

The application works in such a way that it initially shows a list of items (called Hits)
these Hits show the title of the Hit, the author of the same and the date of publication

in the list of hits the user can slide the item from the list to delete that item from the list and not see it again

by clicking on the item you will be able to see the detail of that hit that will show the WebView attached to that Hit

# Technologies used

* Jetpack compose as a template for the design of the app

* Injection of dependencies with Hilt to be able to access both the API queries and the data stored in the database

* Retrofit as client Api Rest

* Room as database

* The MVVM architecture and clean architecture were used to make the app scalable
